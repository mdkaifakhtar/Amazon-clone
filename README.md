live demo:
-> (https://mdkaifakhtar.github.io/Amazon-clone/)
📌 Project Description

This is a static clone of the Amazon.in homepage, built using HTML and CSS. It includes multiple sections such as navigation, search bar, product categories, promotional boxes, and footer, mimicking the real Amazon homepage. This project is a UI layout only and does not include any functionality or responsiveness (not mobile-friendly).

It is created for learning and practicing frontend development skills like layout structuring and CSS styling.
🧰 Technologies Used

    HTML5 – To create the structure of the webpage

    CSS3 – To design and style all the elements

    Font Awesome – For icons used in the navigation bar

🚫 Limitations

    ❌ Not responsive – Layout doesn't adapt to smaller screen sizes (mobile/tablet).

    ❌ No interactivity – Buttons and links are not functional.

    ❌ No backend – This is just a frontend design.
